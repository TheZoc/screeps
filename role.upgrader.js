     * This function runs the Upgrader behavior for the given creep.
     * It is a finite state machine with 2 possible states: Upgrading or not.
     *
     * If the creep has just spawned, look for a resource pool to collect from
     * and will proceed in the not building state.
     *
     * Not-Upgrading state:
     * Do some sanity checks for the resource pool to collect from, and start moving
     * on it's way. If it's a source, harvest from. If it's a container, transfer
     * (collect) from.
     * If at least 50% of it's capacity is collected from the resource pool, it will
     * transition to the Upgrading state. Otherwise, it will look for another source
     * to fill it's container.
     *
     * Upgrader state:
     * The creep will move to the Room Controller and upgrade it until it runs out
     * of energy.
     *
     * The main.js file is responsible to assign the creep to the Upgrader role if there
     * isn't any building work to do.
