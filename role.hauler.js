     * This function runs the Hauler behavior for the given creep.
     * It is a finite state machine with 2 possible states: Withdrawing or not.
     *
     * If the creep has just spawned, it will look for a resource pool and then
     * it will continue in the withdraw state.
     *
     * Withdraw state:
     * Move to the target resource pool and collect resources.
     * If a transfer (collect) action had resources, but not enough to fill the
     * creep store capacity, the creep does an early deliver, instead of waiting
     * for the resources to be available.
     *
     * Deliver (non-withdraw) state:
     * Go to the nearest Tower, Spawn or Extension that needs resources, and
     * transfer them there. Do this until there's no more resources being carried.
     * (This logic definitely can be improved with priorities!)
     * If every Spawn, Container and Extension are filled, transfer to our storage.
     * If storage is full, move to the nearest Spawn and idle there.
